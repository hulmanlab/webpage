Benjamin was a postdoctoral researcher at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus until September 2025. He worked on applying his engineering skills to develop digital solutions for health care. 
He has a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from DTU Compute, where he used ubiquitous computing, data mining and machine learning to enhance hearing health care and user experience.
At the Hulman Lab, Benjamin worked on the technical infrastructure, collaborated with external partners, mentored undergraduate and PhD students, and bridged the gap between clinicians and machine learning researchers. He also lead innovation sprints and projects that aimed to deliver tangible outcomes. Since ending his postdoc position Benjamin now is a machine learning ingeneer at [Neurospace](https://neurospace.io/).
