Lærke holds a bachelor's degree in Public Health Science from  Aarhus University. With an interest in data science and a desire to make a difference for people, she is motivated by the interdisciplinary and diverse research community at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. She is fascinated by how complex problems call for complex solutions, which she believes are often found in the collaboration between different fields. Lærke is a part-time student assistant in the lab, where her primary role is to help with communication activities and practical organisational tasks.
