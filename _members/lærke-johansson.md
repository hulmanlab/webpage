Lærke holds a bachelor's degree in Public Health Science from  Aarhus University. Her bachelor project was a qualitative study on patient perspectives on AI-assisted diabetes care. With an interest in data science and a desire to make a difference for people, she is motivated by the interdisciplinary and diverse research community at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. She is fascinated by how complex problems call for complex solutions, which she believes are often found in the collaboration between different fields. Lærke is a part-time assistant in the lab. In addition to continuing her qualitative study, her role is to help with communication activities and practical organizational tasks in the group.
