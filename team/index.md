# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Our lab shares the passion for data science and a thrive to make a difference for people with diabetes. We come from diverse backgrounds (data science, engineering, epidemiology, mathematics, medicine, sport science) and enjoy collaborations across disciplines. We aim to create a professional working environment that embraces our differences, encourages out-of-the-box thinking (sometimes using LEGO(R) bricks), and where there is a place for the famous Danish ‘hygge’.

[Benjamin] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/johansenbenjamin/) was a postdoctoral researcher at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus from [X-Y], where he applied his engineering skills to develop digital solutions for health care. He has a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from DTU Compute, where he used ubiquitous computing, data mining and machine learning to enhance hearing health care and user experience. At the Hulman Lab, Benjamin oversees the technical infrastructure, collaborates with external partners, mentors undergraduate and PhD students, and bridges the gap between clinicians and machine learning researchers. He also leads innovation sprints and projects that aim to deliver tangible outcomes. Benjamin is now a machine learning engineer at [Neurospace] (https://neurospace.io/).
